# ðŸª™ Trash Loot Bonus Event

You will receive +50% or more trash loot when killing monsters. The percent value might change for each event.

The **extra trash loot items will come to your Black Spirit's Safe and will only show after you relog**. So you won't directly get it from monsters, system will give you once you obtain the trash loot item and after you relog or swap characters etc

This event includes custom spots and mostly high level spots. If there is any type of item that is not included and if you don't receive extra to Black Spirit's Safe contact us with item name or item codex link

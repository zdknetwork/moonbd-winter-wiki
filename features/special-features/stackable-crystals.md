# ðŸ’š Stackable Crystals

Some crystals are now stackable for taking up less space in inventory

### However there is known bug

If you have more than 1x stackable crystal in your inventory. It will give error and you will not be able to put it on your item. In order to avoid this put the rest of the crystals you have to Market Storage or City Storage.

Basically you must have only 1 in order to put it on an item
